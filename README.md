# SIH-Final-Project
This project develops an AI-powered diagnostic software that analyses transformer Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) data to detect mechanical and electrical faults such as winding deformation, core displacement, and insulation degradation. It supports multi-format data from vendors like Omicron, Megger, and Doble, unifies them for analysis
